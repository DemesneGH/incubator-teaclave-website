<h3>Secure and Attestable</h3>
<p>
Teaclave adopts multiple security technologies to enable secure computing,
in particular, Teaclave uses Intel SGX to serve the most security-sensitive
tasks with hardware-based isolation, memory encryption and attestation.
Also, Teaclave is written in Rust to prevent memory-safety issues.

<div class="feature">
<h3>Function-as-a-Service</h3>
<p> Teaclave is a
function-as-a-service platform supports tasks like privacy-preserving machine
learning, private set intersection, and crypto computation. In addition,
developers can also write and execute Python function.
Teaclave supports both
general secure computing tasks and flexible multi-party secure computation.
</p>

<div class="feature">
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<p> Teaclave builds its
components in containers, therefore, it supports deployment both locally and
within cloud infrastructures. Teaclave also provides convenient endpoint APIs,
client SDKs and command line tools. </p>
</div>

<div class="feature">
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p> Components in Teaclave are designed in
modular, and some like remote attestation can be easily embedded in other
projects. In addition, Teaclave SGX SDK can also be used separately to write
standalone SGX enclaves for other purposes. </p>
