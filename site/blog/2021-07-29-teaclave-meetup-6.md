We are going to have the monthly Teaclave (virtual) meetup. The
meetup in this month is scheduled on July 29, 2021 (PT):

- 19:00-20:00 on Thursday, July 29, 2021 (PT)

You can find the corresponding date time in your TZ here:

As usual, Mingshen will give an update of Teaclave first. Then, if there's no
specific topic this time, we will have an open discussion session on recent
news/projects around confidential computing.

At last, same as the previous meetup, please RSVP (in the Teaclave dev mailing
list) for the Zoom link. Thanks!
