We are going to have the 9th monthly Teaclave (virtual) meetup. Since
November 25 is around Thanksgiving, I suggest putting it after
Thanksgiving on Nov 30th, 2021 PT:

- 19:00-20:00 on Tuesday, Nov 30, 2021 (PT)

You can find the corresponding date time in your time zone here:

We are glad to have Jinhua Cui and Zhijingcheng Yu from National
University of Singapore joining our meetup to talk about their recent
study about the re-entrancy vulnerability in the exception handling
designs of some popular SGX SDKs and the SmashEx attack. [1, 2]

I also create a Google Calendar for the recurring events. Please
subscribe if you're interested.

At last, same as the previous meetup, please RSVP for the Zoom link
(or find it in the shared calendar). Thanks!
