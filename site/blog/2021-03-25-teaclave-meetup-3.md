## Schedule

**Abstract**

Confidential computing is an emerging security feature provided by more and more
public cloud service providers (e.g., Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google
Cloud) in order to help customers protect their sensitive data in the cloud
environment. Some popular confidential computing services include Intel Software
Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves and AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)
VMs. These services are usually atop different hardware-based Trusted Execution
Environments (TEE) technologies.

Meanwhile, to help convince the customers the trustworthiness of the platform
hardware and the integrity of codes inside the TEE, cloud services providers
also offer remote attestation services. In this talk, we will first cover the
remote attestation workflow provided by some famous cloud TEE services,
including Azure Open Enclave, Nitro Enclave, Google confidential computing VM
and Fortanix. From the perspective of customers, we also focus on the
attestation reports the customers can get. We then introduce Teaclave's current
attestation design and discuss the attestation report standard Teaclave should
follow.
