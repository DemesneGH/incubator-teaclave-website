# Community

Welcome to the Teaclave community. Here are several ways that you can get involved.

## Mailing Lists

We have a few mailing lists hosted by Apache:

- **Developer mailing list**: A list for discussion on Teaclave development. To
  subscribe, send an email to
  [dev-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org).
  Once subscribed, you can have discussion on Teaclave development by mailing to
  [dev@teaclave.apache.org](mailto:dev@teaclave.apache.org). Archives are
  available [here](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@teaclave.apache.org).
- **Commit mailing list**: A list to track Teaclave commits. To subscribe, send
  an email to
  [commits-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org](mailto:commits-subscribe@teaclave.apache.org).
  Archives are available

To unsubscribe from any of these, just change the word "subscribe" to
"unsubscribe" in the email addresses above.

## Contributing

Teaclave is open source in [The Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/),
we aim to create a project that is maintained and owned by the community. All
kinds of contributions are welcome. Read this [document](CONTRIBUTING.md) to
learn more about how to contribute. Huge thanks to our [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take a very active stance in eliminating security problems in Teaclave. We
strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private mailing list
first ([private@teaclave.apache.org](mailto:private@teaclave.apache.org)),
before disclosing them in a public forum.
